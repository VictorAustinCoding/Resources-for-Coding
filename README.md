# Resources-for-Coding
This is just a folder containing the data for my website that is a resource hub.
This resource hub will be used to access all of my resources in one location.
It will contain links pertaining to good websites for coding resources.
These websites include and are not limited to HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT at the moment.
I have a seperate section for OPCOLLEGE specific links in the next section.
